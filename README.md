# Basic-ToDo-
 This is my first JavaScript CRUD work.
 I'm new into web development and just started JavaScript 2 months ago. I have been learning and being stucked in tutorial hell that i learn, understand the concept, but can't build any real world thing with it. But one day when i was scrolling through ATO Tech(a tech guru, senior dev) profile/page i came across one of his content talking about the DOM manipulations, for the first time i came across and understood createElement, appendChild and other concepts i learnt as i was building, then i decided to test and check the functions of these DOM's like the createElement and appendChild when from there i got the inspiration and the logic to build this Basic-ToDo which features 
 ðŸ”² Create

 please your feedback will be so helpful to me
